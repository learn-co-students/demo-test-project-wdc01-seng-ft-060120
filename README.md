# Demo Project: Create a Checkers Game

A repo will be considered a Project in learn if there is a `.learn` file present.

### .learn file expected format

You can customize the checkable review criteria for your project.

```
project:
  review_criteria:
    - Game has 2 players
    - Game Passes specs
    - Uses Ember
    - Reviewed on Github
```

Alternatively, there is a default checklist:

1. Project builds properly
2. Project meets requirements
3. All tests pass
4. Code is readable

To use the default checklist, the `.learn` must contain:

```
project:
  review_criteria: []
```
